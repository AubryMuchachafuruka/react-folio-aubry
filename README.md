# 👨🏼‍💻 Reactfolio — A Portfolio Built with React, Vite & Tailwind

Welcome to **Reactfolio**, a personal portfolio project crafted by **Aubrey**, a final-year Computer Systems Engineering student majoring in **React.js**, **Vite**, and **Tailwind CSS**. This site is part of a growing collection of hands-on builds demonstrating frontend mastery and creative outreach.

## 🎯 Purpose

This portfolio was designed to:
- Showcase technical skills in modern frontend development
- Serve as a demo for future outreach projects like **MathMaster Hub** and **Jamela Cakes Academy**
- Reflect Aubrey’s commitment to clean design, responsive layouts, and audience-friendly presentation

---

## 🤖 Technology Stack  
- [React](https://react.dev) — Component-based UI library  
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) — Lightning-fast build tool  
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) — Utility-first styling framework
